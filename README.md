# Browzio1.0
#### This assistant was developed by **Me** and one of my friend in college. We started our project by thinking of developing an AI for india, made in India. Although a similar project was also on internet but we built it from scratch. All the libraries, modules and functions are written by us.

> - This Project made us familiar with the concept of looping statements, what is the importance of defining functions in any program, and how to utilize the hardware with software(as it is using your machine as hardware to interact). 
> - It is one step close to available Voice Assistants like Google assistant, Alexa and Cortana.
#### We have used may ***Python Libraries*** which includes -
> - sqlite3 
> - subprocess
> - bs4
> - cv2
> - wolframalpha
> - pyttsx3
> - tkinter
> - json
> - random
> - operator
> - speech_recognition
> - datetime
> - wikipedia
> - webbrowser
> - os
> - winshell
> - pyjokes
> - feedparser
> - smtplib
> - ctypes
> - time
> - requests
> - shutil
> - twilio.rest 
> - clint.textui
> - ecapture
> - bs4 
> - win32com.client as wincl
> - urllib.request
> - translate
> - language_tool_python
#### All these Libraries made our project to work well. But the limitations were also there.

#### This Program can do the following - 
> - **It wish with respect to time to the user everytime we run the program(like Good morning/afternoon/evening).**
> - **General talking is available for users- commnds like How are you, I am good, etc.**
> - **It can perform various operations like opening various websites, parsing data from website and obtaining the output, knowing weather conditions in specific places, etc.**
> - **Can perform system operations like shut down, hibernate, restart, taking note and sending email, opening powerpoint presentations.**
> - **Also, plays, stops, and opens my music directory.**
> - **Can tell some jokes using Pyjokes library.**
> - **Tell me news fro The Time Of India, Change Backgrouds of my Desktop as well!**
> - **Translate to few popular languages like, Hindi, Marathi, Spanish, German and French for now(we will try to add more for sure!).**
#### These are some of the functions that we built in the assistant! 

#### Limitations of our Project - 
> - **We could not integrate any database system like SQL,etc. to handle a list of commands.**
> - **The program sometimes run well and some times not (on our machine), due to processor limitations and available memory limitation.**
> - **Our code is not much memory optimized to run quickly. We doveloped this whole code in our First Year.**
> - **We Tried to optimize the code but failed due to less knowledge of Data structures**.
